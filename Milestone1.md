# Happiness and Income Analysis 
# Abby Scarry and Nicole Davis 

## Dataset 
We have selected a dataset from the word happiness report [(https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2024/#appendices-and-data)] which contains data on happiness and contributing factors from many countries over time. The variables include Life Ladder (acts as happiness score), Log GDP per capita, and other contributing factors such as social support, health life expectancy at birth, etc. We chose this dataset because we want to explore the relationship between income and happiness levels, focusing on the fact that money doesn't buy happiness, or income level is not always correlated with higher reported happiness.

## Questions
Does income correlate with happiness (using data across different countries)?
Are there other factors (like social support or life expectancy) that impact happiness more than income?

## Collaboration Plan
We set up a public GitHub repository to share our code and files. We plan to meet and communicate online as needed for each Milestone. We will use the Github to share and track what we have as well as using Google Colab for development and testing that we can easily collaborate on.
